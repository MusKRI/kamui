title: Introduction
description: Pure UI is a minimalist design system focused on clean aesthetics, raw functionality, and uncompromising simplicity for modern web applications.

**This is not another component library. This is pure design distilled to its essence.**

Pure UI strips away the unnecessary, leaving only what matters: clean code, minimal complexity, raw functionality, and purposeful motion.

Most design systems overwhelm you with options, variants, and abstractions. **Pure UI takes the opposite approach—every component exists for a reason, every line of code serves a purpose, every animation has intent.**

Pure UI is built around these core principles:

- **Minimal Complexity:** No bloated APIs or unnecessary abstractions.
- **Raw Functionality:** Direct access to component internals without layers of wrapper logic.
- **Clean Aesthetics:** Carefully crafted defaults that prioritize clarity over decoration.
- **Purposeful Motion:** Animations that enhance usability, not distract from it.
- **Open Code:** Full transparency with modifiable source code.
- **Zero Compromise:** Performance and simplicity over feature bloat.

## Raw Functionality

Pure UI gives you the actual component code—no black boxes, no hidden abstractions. This means:

- **Direct Control:** Modify any aspect of a component without fighting the framework.
- **Predictable Behavior:** What you see is what you get—no hidden side effects.
- **Performance First:** Lean implementations without unnecessary overhead.
- **Clean Implementation:** Every line serves a purpose, readable by humans and AI.

## Purposeful Motion

Animation in Pure UI isn't decoration—it's functional communication:

- **Physics-Based:** Natural spring animations and easing curves that feel right.
- **Preset System:** Curated animation presets like `butter`, `silk`, `velvet` for consistent feel.
- **Performance Optimized:** Hardware-accelerated transforms and opacity changes only.
- **Respect Motion Preferences:** Built-in `reduceMotion` support for accessibility.
- **Clean Animation Code:** Simple, readable animation definitions you can modify.

```tsx
// Clean animation syntax
<Accordion animationPreset="motion" transitionPreset="butter">
  <AccordionItem>Motion with purpose</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Minimal by Design

Every component in Pure UI serves a specific purpose with minimal API surface:

- **Essential Variants:** Only the variants you actually need.
- **Clean Defaults:** Sensible styling that works out of the box.
- **Intentional Constraints:** Opinionated choices that prevent decision paralysis.
- **Readable Source:** Component code that's clean enough to learn from.

## Clean Code Philosophy

Pure UI prioritizes code clarity and maintainability:

- **No Magic:** Every behavior is explicit and traceable.
- **Readable Patterns:** Consistent naming and structure across components.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** Only essential libraries, nothing superfluous.
- **Type Safety:** Full TypeScript support with clear interfaces.

_Pure UI doesn't try to be everything to everyone. It focuses on being exactly what you need, nothing more._
