**This is another component hub.**

Pure UI strips away the unnecessary, leaving only what matters: clean code, minimal complexity, raw functionality, and purposeful motion.

Pure UI is built around these core principles:

- **Minimal Complexity:** No bloated APIs or unnecessary abstractions.
- **Raw Functionality:** Direct access to component internals without layers of wrapper logic.
- **Clean Aesthetics:** Carefully crafted defaults that prioritize clarity over decoration.
- **Purposeful Motion:** Animations that enhance usability, not distract from it.
- **Open Code:** Full transparency with modifiable source code.
- **Zero Compromise:** Performance and simplicity over feature bloat.
